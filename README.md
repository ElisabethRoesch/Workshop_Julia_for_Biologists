# Workshop: Julia for Biologists
Online material for the Workshop: "Julia for Biologists" to be presented at AMSI's BIS 2022: https://bis.amsi.org.au

In the first part of the workshop we explore a high level demonstration in [Visual Studio Code](https://www.julia-vscode.org/) via the `demo_julia_syntax.jl` script. This involves a reaction network model with [Catalyst.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/Catalyst/stable/).

In the second part of the workshop we use Jupyter and the `TheDoublingPopulation.ipynb` notebook. This example demonstrates basic simulation and data analysis.

Some additional recommended resources are:

* [Julia for Biologists](https://github.com/ElisabethRoesch/Perspective_Julia_for_Biologists) - A diverse collection of Julia code examples for biologists.
* [Statistics with Julia](https://statisticswithjulia.org/) - An elementary statistics book with over 200 stand alone Julia examples.
* [Programming of Simulation, Analysis, and Learning Systems](https://courses.smp.uq.edu.au/MATH2504/2022/) - A programming course for mathematicians using Julia. Online videos and online content. 
* [The Julia Express](https://github.com/bkamins/The-Julia-Express) - Very dense summary
* [Introduction to Julia | Jose Storopoli | JuliaCon 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiQpwMQZBTA) - Useful 3 hour video - starts with a good overview of the package manager.
* [Statistics with Julia from the ground up | Workshop | JuliaCon 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlPoU5Yr2QI) - A 3 hour workshop of Julia basics in the context of statistics.
